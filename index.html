	<h1>Kolibri in your web browser</h1>

    <p>
	Kolibri is normally accessed using a web browser (or embedded web browser),
    however it relies on a Kolibri server backend which is written in Python.
    This architecture brings some complexity to deploying Kolibri - a suitable
    Python interpreter must be available for your OS, you have to run it, it
    has to open a socket, etc. Notably, this complicates the prospect of
    Kolibri as a ChromeOS app.
    </p>

    <p>
    This experiment runs the Kolibri server entirely within your browser.
    It does this by creating a javascript thread where a Python interpreter is run (pyodide, using WebAssembly).
    </p>

    <p>
    It takes a few minutes to load - one of the first learnings from this experiment. Watch the javascript console to see things moving.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once loaded, this page will be replaced by the Kolibri loading animation.
    (More work ongoing to make it progress beyond this stage!)
