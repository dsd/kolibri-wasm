Kolibri depends on SQLAlchemy, which has C code, hence we need to build
a pyodide module for it.

I largely followed the procedure here, to create meta.yaml:
https://pyodide.org/en/stable/development/new-packages.html

As a prerequisite that basically means you have to build (at least part of)
pyiodide and that is tricky.

Build from source instructions:
https://pyodide.org/en/stable/development/building-from-sources.html

I wasn't able to get those instructions working on Debian Bullseye toolbox
container inside Endless OS - with others reporting similar failures at
present. I wasn't able to use podman to do their docker approach either
- assorted difficulties there.

In the end I installed Ubuntu and used their docker setup to build it.
I couldn't figure out how to install the end result though.
Ended up using pip to install pyodide-build from pypi.
Then copy Makefile.envs /src/.docker_home/.local/lib/python3.9/Makefile.envs
Now "pyodide-build mkpkg" works and produces meta.yaml (but it gets placed
in .local/lib/ too).
Put that in the packages/sqlalchemy directory and now you can build.

Trust the result calling it sqlalchemy not SQLAlchemy. The name gets converted
to lowercase during building and loading, seems to be intentional.
